<p>
<span>History</span></p>
<p>
    In the summer of 1960, a serendipitous mix-up involving a shipment of textbooks, a crate of mangoes, and a misdelivered grand piano led to the accidental founding of the International State College of the Philippines (ISCP). Legend has it that the original founders were actually a group of overenthusiastic bingo players who mistook a government land grant for a prize. Deciding to make the best of the situation, they pooled their winnings and established what would become the most whimsically prestigious institution in the archipelago. <br><br>

    Campus Chaos: From Jungle to Genius
    
    The early days of ISCP were nothing short of chaotic brilliance. The campus, initially a dense jungle, was cleared by an army of volunteer students armed with machetes and a dream. The first classrooms were a hodgepodge of repurposed nipa huts, shipping containers, and the aforementioned grand piano, which served as both a lectern and an impromptu stage for faculty talent shows.<br><br>
    
    Curricular Curiosities: A Smorgasbord of Subjects
    
    ISCP quickly gained fame for its eclectic curriculum. Alongside traditional subjects, students could enroll in courses such as "Advanced Aswang Studies," "Karaoke Philosophy," and "Tarsier Telepathy 101." The institution's motto, "Magis May Asim," roughly translates to "With More Zest," capturing its commitment to spicing up education.<br><br>
    
    International Intrigue: The Student Exchange Fiasco
    
    In the 1970s, ISCP attempted to launch an international student exchange program. Due to a series of typographical errors and some imaginative map-reading, the first batch of exchange students ended up in Iceland, where they pioneered a fusion cuisine of lutefisk and adobo. The incident, while diplomatically delicate, ultimately expanded ISCP's culinary arts program and earned the school an honorary Nordic citizenship.<br><br>
    
    Technological Triumphs and Tribulations
    
    The 1980s saw ISCP embrace technology with gusto, albeit with mixed results. The introduction of the "Kubo-computer," a bamboo-encased mainframe, was hailed as an eco-friendly innovation until termites brought it to an untimely demise. Undeterred, the tech department rebounded with the development of the "Banana-powered Battery," which, while ineffective, did lead to the campus becoming a national leader in potassium-rich diets.<br><br>
    
    Mascot Mayhem: The Carabao Conundrum
    
    ISCP's beloved mascot, the Carabao, has its own storied history. Initially chosen for its embodiment of hard work and resilience, the live mascot, "Bessie the Carabao," was known to occasionally wander into lectures, chew on important documents, and once, infamously, delivered a surprise guest lecture on agricultural economics. Her untamed spirit continues to inspire the student body to this day.<br><br>
    
    The Present Day: Embracing Eccentricity
    
    Today, ISCP stands as a testament to the power of creativity, resilience, and a touch of absurdity. The campus has expanded into a world-class facility that still proudly displays its quirky origins. Cutting-edge research labs coexist with whimsical art installations, and the annual "Founders' Bingo Night" remains a cherished tradition.<br><br>
    
    Join the Fun
    
    Whether you're a student with a penchant for the peculiar, a professor with a flair for the fantastical, or a visitor drawn by curiosity, the International State College of the Philippines welcomes you with open arms and an open mind. At ISCP, we celebrate the unconventional, the unexpected, and the undeniably extraordinary. After all, where else can you earn a degree in "Mango Management" while dancing to the tunes of a grand piano in the jungle?</p>

<h2>Go <span>Beyond!</span></h2>
<p align="center"> Our<span> Moon Campus!</span></p>
    <p>In the summer of 1990, inspired by a combination of Cold War space race nostalgia and an overstock of dehydrated mangoes, the Board of Trustees at the International State College of the Philippines (ISCP) decided to boldly go where no college had gone before: the Moon. Fueled by the audacious spirit of innovation and a generous misinterpretation of government funding guidelines, the ISCP Moon Campus was conceived. <br><br>

    Fundraising Fiascos: Selling Space
    
    Raising funds for a lunar campus proved to be a challenge. Initial efforts included a series of wildly successful yet utterly bizarre fundraisers. Highlights included the "Zero-Gravity Zumba Marathon," the "Lunar Luge Slide" (a mudslide extravaganza on a steep hill in the rainy season), and the "Intergalactic Bingo Night," which, due to a typo, promised winners an actual plot on the Moon. To everyone's surprise, this last event raised enough money to secure a partnership with a dubious yet enthusiastic aerospace startup, "Rocket R' Us." <br><br>
    
    Construction Commotion: Building the Unbuildable
    
    Building a campus on the Moon posed unique challenges. The first shipment of materials was accidentally launched into the Sun, and the second attempt saw the construction crew accidentally sent to Mars, where they briefly became local celebrities. After several more hiccups, including a misunderstanding with NASA that led to a temporary lunar traffic jam, construction finally began. <br><br>
    
    Lunar Logistics: Unpacking the Campus
    
    With materials and workers finally on the Moon, the construction phase kicked off in earnest. The first building to be completed was the "Lunar Lecture Hall," made from a combination of Moon rock and recycled soda cans. It was swiftly followed by the "Crater Cafeteria," known for its out-of-this-world lunar lattes and meteorite muffins. The "Space Dorms" featured panoramic views of Earth, though complaints about moon dust allergies were common. <br><br>
    
    Curricular Capers: Moon-themed Majors
    
    To justify its existence, the Moon Campus offered a range of unique courses. Students could major in "Astro-AgriBusiness," "Extraterrestrial Economics," "Lunar Literature," and the ever-popular "Space Snack Science." The "Interstellar Internship Program" partnered with the Martian Mining Company and Venusian Vineyards, providing hands-on experience in off-planet industries. <br><br>
    
    Student Life: Moon Myths and Realities
    
    Student life on the Moon was as unique as the campus itself. The "Low-G Dance Parties" became legendary, and the "Anti-Gravity Gymnastics Team" won intergalactic accolades. However, not everything was smooth sailing. The "Lunar Laundry" often failed to account for the lack of water, resulting in students adopting a "dust-it-off" approach to cleanliness. The traditional "Moon Festival" featured spacewalk races and crater diving competitions, attracting spectators from as far as Jupiter. <br><br>
    
    Mascot Mania: The Cosmic Carabao
    
    Maintaining tradition, ISCP introduced a lunar variant of its beloved mascot, Bessie the Carabao. The "Cosmic Carabao" quickly became a symbol of lunar resilience, although attempts to have an actual carabao live on the Moon were short-lived and resulted in a new crater being named in her honor. <br><br>
    
    Legacy and Lunacy: A Lasting Impact
    
    Despite the many challenges, the ISCP Moon Campus became a symbol of human ingenuity, creativity, and the occasional bout of cosmic craziness. It attracted students, faculty, and curious extraterrestrials, fostering a unique community that thrived in the most unlikely of places. <br><br>
    
    Join the Lunar Loonies
    
    If you're drawn to the bizarre and the brilliant, the ISCP Moon Campus is the place for you. Where else can you study "Meteorite Music" while sipping a Moon milkshake under the Earthrise? At ISCP's Moon Campus, we don't just shoot for the stars—we build our classrooms among them. <br><br>
